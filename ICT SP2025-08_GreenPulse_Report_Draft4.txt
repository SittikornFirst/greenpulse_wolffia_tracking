CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
      This chapter introduces the problem statements, the objectives, the scope, the benefits of this project, and the methodology overview.
1.1 Problem Statement
      Wolffia globosa is a highly nutritious aquatic plant with increasing demand both domestically and internationally. However, cultivating Wolffia globosa is challenging due to its specific water quality and environmental control. Many factors influence growth, including pH, temperature, light intensity, nutrient content in water, dissolved oxygen, plant density, and salinity. If these factors are not optimal, the plant can easily slow down, stop growing, or lose its yield. This complex management requires knowledge, experience, and continuous care.�
      Currently, most farmers still rely on manual water quality measurements, which have several limitations. For example, measurements require a longer time, typically   15 - 20 minutes per measurement, and are typically performed only once or twice a day. This is insufficient to monitor the changes in pH, temperature, and light intensity that can occur continuously over 24 hours. Furthermore, the lack of immediate alerts for abnormalities causes delays in corrective action. These constraints ultimately make Wolffia globosa cultivation complex and demanding of both time and specialized experience.
      To overcome current limitations, this project will develop an integrated Internet of Things (IoT) monitoring system for Wolffia globosa cultivation. The system continuously measures key water quality and environmental parameters and transmits real-time data to farmers, allowing them to improve water conditions quickly. By providing accurate and timely data, this system aims to increase yield quality, reduce the risk of loss, and improve the efficiency of Wolffia globosa cultivation.
1.2 Objectives of the Project
      To design and develop �GreenPulse�, an IoT-based water quality and environment monitoring system for Wolffia globosa farming, integrating the following key components:
* IoT Embedded System: Offer continuous monitoring of critical water quality and environmental parameters essential for Wolffia globosa growth.�
* Web Application Dashboards: Provide user interfaces for real-time data visualization, historical trend analysis, instant actionable alerts.
1.3 Scope of the Project
      The scope of the project includes the following:
* Target User Groups
o Wolffia globosa Farmers: Small to medium-scale farmers who seek to improve productivity and reduce crop losses by monitoring water quality and environmental factors in real-time.�
o Agricultural Researchers: Institutions and researchers studying aquatic plants that require continuous data on water quality for experimentation and optimization.
o Food Industry Partners: Companies sourcing Wolffia globosa as a food ingredient that want traceable, high-quality, and safe production practices.�
* Main Features
o IoT Sensor Module: Continuous measurement of key parameters including water pH, EC (Electrical Conductivity), air temperature, water temperature and light intensity, with proper calibration and compensation.�[NS1]
o Real-time Data Transmission: Sensor data transmitted to a back-end system for storage and processing.
o Web Application: A user-friendly interface that allows farmers to view water quality status, environmental factors, and historical trends, and receive actionable recommendations.
o Alerts and Notifications: Threshold-based alerts (Such as abnormal pH, high temperature) are displayed on a web-based dashboard to enable timely corrective actions.
* System Constraints
o Sensor Accuracy and Calibration: The system relies on the accuracy of sensors. Regular calibration and maintenance are required to ensure reliable and accurate reading.
o Sensor connectivity: The system requires a stable internet or mobile network connection to synchronize real-time data with the cloud-based back-end system.
o Environmental Durability: Outdoor use requires a weatherproof enclosure and proper waterproofing to prevent corrosion and water damage.
o Power Supply: IoT devices require battery power, so efficient power management is required to ensure continuous operation in outdoor environments.�
1.4 Expected Benefits
* Improving agricultural production efficiency: Continuously controlling water quality and environmental factors helps to maintain the continuous growth of the Wolffia globosa and ensure efficient production.
* Rapid problem detection: Real-time alerts help farmers quickly detect improper water conditions, reducing the risk of crop loss.
* Collect data for analysis: Collecting and displaying historical data allows farmers and researchers to analyze trends to improve farming strategies and long-term results. 
1.5 Methodology Overview

Figure 1.5 System Development and Implementation overview[NS2]
      Figure 1.5 presents an overview of our methodology. The [NS3]GreenPulse project development follows a systematic, sequential approach that integrates requirements gathering, system design, hardware implementation, software development, system testing, and field deployment. Beginning with requirement gathering and literature review in phase 1, the team established project foundations by analyzing existing Wolffia globosa cultivation practices and reviewing related IoT systems. This phase informed the overall system design direction. Phase 2 involves system design, which separates the project into two interconnected tracks: designing the embedded system for IoT embedded system and the web-based dashboard system for data processing and visualization.?
      Phase 3 separates into two parallel implementation streams. Track 3.1 focuses on developing the backend and storage infrastructure, including API development, database design, and analytics/alert systems. Simultaneously, track 3.2 addresses hardware prototype implementation and sensor setup, establishing the physical foundation for environmental monitoring. These implementations converge into phase 3.3, where embedded software is developed for the ESP32 microcontroller, enabling sensor data collection, local logging, and MQTT communication.?



      Phase 4 involves comprehensive sensor calibration to ensure accurate and reliable environmental parameter measurements. Once individual components are calibrated, phase 5 proceeds with system integration and testing, where embedded software, backend services, and web interface are unified and tested for proper data flow from sensors through cloud processing to user dashboards. This comprehensive testing validates that all system components communicate correctly and that alerts trigger appropriately when environmental parameters exceed defined thresholds.?
      Finally, phase 6 consists of field pilot and validation, where the complete GreenPulse system is deployed at an actual Wolffia globosa cultivation site. Real-world testing at an operational farm validates system performance, user interface usability, and the practical effectiveness of environmental monitoring for Wolffia globosa growth maintenance. This field validation phase ensures the system meets farmer requirements and generates measurable improvements in cultivation efficiency before broader deployment.?
      

CHAPTER 2
BACKGROUND
      This chapter provides an overview of Wolffia farming, the environmental and nutritional factors influencing its growth, the water quality and environmental parameters and thresholds that must be controlled, as well as common problems, pond management, and challenges observed in practice. 
 
2.1 Overview of Wolffia globosa
      Wolffia spp., belonging to the family Lemnaceae, commonly known as duckweed, is widely recognized for its high nutritional value, particularly protein, essential amino acids, and vitamins, making it a promising sustainable food source. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, among the Wolffia species, Wolffia globosa is a prominent and widely recognized species and has become an emerging agricultural product in Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries. However, maintaining consistent yield and quality requires effective management of environmental conditions, particularly water quality, which plays a central role in Wolffia globosa cultivation [1].
2.2 Environmental and Nutritional Factors
      The information presented in this chapter is partly based on field data and observations collected during a site visit to ��ҹ��� by Thai Wolffia (Thai Wolffia globosa farm), a Wolffia globosa cultivation site in Thailand.
* Water Quality: Water is the most critical factor in Wolffia globosa farming. Poor water quality directly affects taste, smell, and overall product quality. The key parameters include:
o pH: Optimal growth occurs between 6.2 and 7.5, with the best range being 6.6 - 6.8. Values below 6.2 cause water to turn green and degrade quickly, while values above 7.5 promote algae growth.
o Temperature: Wolffia globosa grows best when water temperature is maintained between 25 - 27?C, while ambient temperatures outside greenhouses may reach up to 35?C.
o Electrical [NS4]Conductivity (EC): EC measures the water's ability to conduct electrical current, which directly reflects the concentration of dissolved mineral ions and nutrients. Lower EC indicates insufficient minerals and nutrients, while higher EC suggests excess salt accumulation. Maintaining balanced EC around 500 - 1500 ?S/cm to ensures proper nutrient availability for optimal Wolffia growth.
o Water treatment: Reverse Osmosis (RO) and Ultraviolet (UV) filtration are commonly used to reduce contamination and extend pond water lifespan. Recent practices also suggest using koi pond�style recirculating water systems, which can extend water usability from 1.5 months up to 3 months.
* Air and Climate:
o Humidity [NS5]in the cultivation house: Humidity significantly affects the quality and growth rate of Wolffia. Moderate humidity levels (typically 60 - 80% relative humidity) are favorable for optimal plant growth. Excessively high humidity can promote fungal diseases and pathogenic growth, while very low humidity can stress the plants and slow growth rates. The ideal humidity range supports photosynthesis efficiency and prevents moisture-related complications.
o Air circulation: Gentle airflow is required to prevent stagnant water, which could lead to water deterioration.


o Weather [NS6]conditions: In general, cool weather is favorable for Wolffia globosa formation, but a new theory suggests that hot and humid conditions can also stimulate its growth. However, fluctuations in weather such as alternating rain and sunshine or overcast skies cause changes in humidity and temperature, which present significant challenges.
o Light intensity: Optimal range are around 10,000 � 12,000 lux to produces the maximum marginal yield.
* Minerals and nutrients: The supplementation of water-soluble NPK fertilizers (16 - 16 - 16 or 20 - 20 - 20) represents the primary method for ensuring adequate nutrient availability to support the growth of Wolffia globosa. Furthermore, Wolffia globosa demonstrates a greater demand for carbon in comparison to oxygen.
* Pests
o Algae: Algae compete with Wolffia globosa for the same nutrients, and excessive algal growth can accumulate as sediment, thereby deteriorating water quality.
o Decayed Wolffia globosa: The presence of even a single decayed Wolffia globosa plant can spread rapidly throughout the pond. Consequently, farmers must regularly monitor and promptly remove any decayed individuals to prevent large-scale contamination.
      Table 2.3 presents the key parameters affecting Wolffia globosa growth, including pH, temperature, and electrical conductivity (EC), along with the optimal and threshold ranges. These guidelines serve as the basis for developing an IoT system for continuous monitoring and controlling Wolffia globosa cultivation conditions.

3.3 Aquaponics Monitoring System Research (1st KEC Conference on Engineering and Technology, September 2018)
      Researchers from Kathford International College of Engineering & Management, part of Tribhuvan University, developed a prototype for an IoT-based aquaponics monitoring system. It combined a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ with an Arduino Nano to create a real-time monitoring solution intended to support the favorable growth of both fish and plants. The system's sensors monitor pH, water temperature, humidity, and water level, while a relay is used for light control. An LCD provides on-site data display, and a web server allows for remote access to information in both graphical and JSON formats, with the system generating warning messages on both displays if parameters deviate from a predefined range. The research concludes that the system is much more efficient and effective than traditional methods and that remarkable outcomes could become visible, though no quantitative data on yield, growth rates, or resource savings were reported. The project successfully demonstrates the feasibility of using a microcomputer-based IoT system to monitor an aquaponics environment and make data accessible remotely via the web. [4]

The system combines a Raspberry Pi 3 microcontroller with a suite of sensors and a cloud backend to automate and remotely manage the growing environment. The integrated sensors monitor key environmental parameters including ambient temperature and humidity (DHT11), pH level of the nutrient solution (SEN1061), Total Dissolved Solids (DF Robot SEN0244) as a proxy for nutrient concentration, and ambient light intensity. Data is transmitted in real-time to a dedicated web server on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and a custom Android mobile application, which allows users to remotely monitor the system and as designed, control elements for regulating water levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and light usage. The research validated the sensor network's efficiency in accurately transmitting data, with future plans to incorporate CO2 sensors, highlighting the project's aim to reduce human intervention and enhance global food security through smart farming. [5]

The system integrated a NodeMCU microcontroller with a suite of sensors to automatically control and monitor the aquaponic environment. The sensors cover water level, pH with a target range of 7 - 7.5, and water temperature with a target range of 20 - 30?C. Data is transmitted to the Ubidots IoT Cloud server and is accessible in real-time via a web dashboard, a local display, and an Android mobile application. The system's automated functions include a fish feeder set to dispense food three times a day, and it incorporates resilience features like a backup water supply and an emergency power source, emphasizing the development of a bio-integrated farming system that reduces the need for frequent manual observation by farmers [6].

CHAPTER 4
METHODOLOGY
 
 
 
 
4.1 System Architecture

Figure 4.1 System Architecture
      Figure 4.1 presents the system architecture of the IoT-based Water Quality and Environment Monitoring System, which monitors and analyzes real-time environmental parameters essential for Wolffia globosa cultivation.
      The proposed IoT-based Water Quality and Environment Monitoring System monitors and analyzes real-time environmental parameters essential for Wolffia globosa cultivation. The architecture consists of two primary components: the Embedded System and the Web Application, as depicted in the system diagram
1.1.1 Embedded System (ESP32-Based Sensing Module)
      The IoT node leverages the ESP32 microcontroller as its core, enabling efficient, low-power processing and real-time wireless communications. The board interfaces with a comprehensive suite of environmental sensors:
* pH Sensor: Measures how acidic or alkaline the water is to ensure suitable growth conditions.
* EC Sensor (Electrical Conductivity): Detects nutrient concentration in the water by measuring its ability to conduct electricity.
* Air Temperature Sensor: Monitors the surrounding air temperature to track environmental conditions for Wolffia growth.
* Water Temperature Sensor: Measures water temperature to ensure it stays within the optimal range.
* Light Intensity Sensor: Measures ambient light reaching the cultivation area. To optimize photosynthesis and growth.  
* Real-Time Clock (RTC) Module: Provides accurate timestamps for each sensor reading, ensuring reliable temporal tracking.
* SD Card Module: Stores collected sensor data locally for logging and backup.
   Operation Flow:
o Sensors sample environmental parameters at set intervals (The default is every 15 min.)
o Each reading is time-stamped by the RTC and buffered for local logging on the SD card.
o As soon as Wi-Fi connectivity is available, buffered readings are encoded into MQTT packets (JSON with device ID, timestamp, and all sensor values) and published to specific topics organized by node/location/type.
o During network disruptions, redundant systems maintain offline operations, to ensure no data is lost. Once the connection is restored, all missed packets are transmitted in batches.
o The node can receive maintenance orders (status checks, configuration updates) over MQTT to maintain proper device health and remote management.
1.1.2 Web Application: Frontend, Backend and Database
* Frontend (Vue.js)
o Realtime Dashboard: Implements MQTT WebSocket subscriptions for live updates without page refresh. Responsive charts and widgets display current parameter values, device status, and trends. 
o Alerts and Notifications: Visual alert mechanisms are embedded when measurements breach predefined thresholds. Notifications are logged and stored for later reference and reporting.  
o Trends & Analytics: Interactive time-series plots, historical comparisons, and summary reports are generated. Users can filter by location, device, or parameter, and export results for documentation. 
o Device Configuration: Secure web forms enable the modification of thresholds and set time intervals.


* Backend (Node.js/Express)
o MQTT Broker: Mosquitto is deployed to manage real-time sensor data streams. The backend subscribes to relevant sensor topics and parses incoming payloads, validating data integrity and flagging anomalies.  
o API Layer: Express RESTful endpoints handle device registration, sensor configuration and historic data retrieval. 
o Device Management: Regular device health checks (status flags, connectivity logs, last activity timestamps) are monitored, allowing the system to detect offline nodes or maintenance needs. 
o Data Analytics: The backend executes threshold comparisons, averaging, event detection (e.g., out-of-range pH), and anomaly detection using statistical. Alerts are generated upon detecting abnormal values and routed to the frontend dashboard in real time. 
* Database (MongoDB)
      The system uses MongoDB as�the primary database to�store sensor�readings, device information, and historical data. Each�data record includes device�identification, sensor measurements�(pH, EC, temperature, light intensity), timestamps, and location�information. MongoDB�was selected for its flexible�document structure,�which accommodates the variable�nature of IoT sensor data,�and its ability�to efficiently�handle time-series queries�needed for trend analysis and real-time monitoring dashboards.

4.3 Database
      Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

Figure 4.3 Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
      Figure 4.3 presents the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) that outlines the database structure and relationships across Users, Farms, Devices, Sensor Data, Alerts, Device Configuration, and System Logs.
* Entity Explanation
      The database schema is designed to support comprehensive monitoring and management of Wolffia globosa cultivation environments through an IoT-based system. It consists of seven interconnected entities that capture user information, farm locations, device deployments, environmental sensor readings, system alerts, device configurations, and operational logs.
o Users: The Users table�stores authentication�credentials and profile�information for�individuals accessing the system. Each user can�manage multiple farms and devices.
o Farms: The Farms table represents physical cultivation sites owned by users. Each farm is characterized by its name, geographic location, and creation timestamp. This entity enables multi-site management and geographic organization of IoT deployments, with each farm hosting a single dedicated IoT monitoring device.
o Devices: The Devices table catalogs all IoT sensor nodes deployed across farms. Each device is assigned to a specific user and farm, with attributes tracking its physical location within the farm, operational status (active, inactive, maintenance), last recorded activity, and timestamps for creation and updates. The table also maintains references to alert and configuration records for comprehensive device management.
o Sensor Data: The Sensor Data table stores time-series environmental measurements collected by IoT devices. Each record captures critical water quality and environmental parameters including pH value, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), water temperature, air temperature, and light intensity. A quality flag attribute indicates data validity and reliability.


o Alerts: The Alerts table logs system-generated notifications triggered when sensor readings exceed predefined thresholds or when devices malfunction. Each alert record references the associated device and optionally links to the specific sensor data reading that triggered the event. Alerts include type classification, severity parameters, threshold values, actual measured values, descriptive messages, and creation timestamps.
o Device Configuration: The Device Configuration table stores operational parameters and threshold settings for each IoT device. Configuration parameters include MQTT topic assignments, alert enablement flags, sampling intervals, and acceptable ranges for each monitored parameter (pH, EC, light intensity, air temperature, water temperature). Each device has exactly one active configuration that governs its monitoring behavior and alert generation.
o System Logs: The System Logs table records operational events for auditing, debugging, and system health monitoring. Each log entry is associated with a device and optionally linked to a specific configuration state. Log attributes include type classification (INFO, WARNING, ERROR), event descriptions, detailed messages, and timestamps.
